              I'm a frontend engineer with five years of experience building
              impactful applications in the EdTech space. My work at Prenda
              helped thousands of microschools deliver personalized education
              through technology. I'm passionate about clean code, thoughtful
              design, and building products that make a difference.

              When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the intersection of technology
              and creativity through music, art, and photo .

              As a musician and artist, I've created experimental bespoke
              instruments that have been featured on CNET and BOOOOOOOM. My work
              explores the relationship between mathematics, nature, and
              sound—from Fibonacci spiral guitars to sculptural pigeon habitats.

              I founded a design studio specializing in whimsical art and
              lifestyle goods. Each project, whether digital or physical,
              reflects my belief that craft and creativity can bridge
              traditional techniques with modern innovation.

              I make music with Jordan Olberg in our band Plastic Jaguar. Our
              debut album, Afterparty, is releasing in 2026, mixed and mastered

                I'm always interested in collaborative projects that blend
