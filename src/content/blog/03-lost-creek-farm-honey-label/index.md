## The Project

Lost Creek Farm, a beautiful homestead in Pepin, Wisconsin, needed a honey label that captured the essence of their artisanal approach to beekeeping and their connection to the land. The farm was [featured in Martha Stewart](https://web.archive.org/web/20230520021014/https://www.marthastewart.com/1541132/lost-creek-farm-pepin-wisconsin-weekend-home-tour), showcasing their dedication to sustainable farming and traditional practices.

## Design Inspiration

The label draws inspiration from Scandinavian folk art, which felt appropriate given Wisconsin's strong Nordic heritage. The design features:

- **Decorative wildlife** - Horses and deer representing the pastoral beauty of the farm
- **Botanical motifs** - Hand-drawn flowers and foliage creating a border of natural elements
- **Bold typography** - "LOST CREEK" prominently displayed with a mix of red and white lettering
- **Dark background** - A deep navy/black base that makes the golden honey visible through the jar while providing strong contrast for the white design elements

## Design Approach

The folk art style serves multiple purposes: it differentiates the product on the shelf, communicates the artisanal nature of the honey, and tells a story about the farm's connection to traditional craftsmanship. The symmetrical composition and hand-drawn quality give it a timeless, authentic feel that resonates with consumers looking for locally-produced, high-quality honey.

The location "Pepin, Wisconsin" is subtly integrated into the design, grounding the product in its geographic origin and appealing to those who value knowing where their food comes from.

## Final Thoughts

Creating a label that balances aesthetic appeal with functional product branding is always a rewarding challenge. For Lost Creek Farm, the folk art approach helped create a memorable visual identity that honors both their craft and their heritage.
