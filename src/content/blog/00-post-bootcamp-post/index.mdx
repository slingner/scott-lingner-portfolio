I graduated from a Bootcamp earlier this year and have been actively applying for jobs throughout California for the past few months.

This article is for any future or current Bootcamp graduates who might need some advice on which steps to take next.

Feel free to check out my work. I‚Äôm currently looking for new opportunities.

## R√©sum√© Advice üìÑ

- If you are interested in the Startup field, Ryan Choi from YCombinator wrote a thorough post on resumes and connecting.
- No typos plz! I like Grammarly for Chrome. This extension has helped me write
  emails, resumes, cover letters, etc.
- A video cover letter could be a great way to stand out. Crash.co seems to be
  the authority.
- If you want a resume quickly, this will get you one in about 15 minutes!
  [Resume Genius](https://resumegenius.com) https://resumegenius.com/
- [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com) has some good articles and an
  interesting approach to AI scanning your resume.

## Job Listings üìã

1. [workatastartup.com](https://workatastartup.com)
   I'm mostly interested in working for a smaller team within a startup, so this website has been very useful for finding opportunities.
2. https://news.ycombinator.com/
   Another great resource in connection with YCombinator is their Who Is Hiring Now monthly postings. A large majority of these postings have direct emails to the recruiters and I have found it to be a much better response rate than the classic LinkedIn of Glassdoor applications. I find these by googling 'y combinator who is hiring now August' (whichever current month). Try to get on these at the beginning of the month!
3. [Dice](https://www.dice.com/)
   Although I'm not as familiar with Dice, I have heard from multiple recruiters that this is a great resource and was really the standard space for job seekers before LinkedIn.
4. [AngelList Jobs](https://angel.co/jobs)
   Another excellent resource for startups. These postings usually have the job poster's name and clearly state what they are looking for. I have had a high percentage of replies and feedback from AngelList applications.
5. [Levels.fyi - Still Hiring](https://www.levels.fyi/still-hiring/)
   Nice site to see which companies are still hiring. There is also a lot of data on here regarding salaries.
6. Google Jobs
   I like using Google jobs because it seems to do a wide-spread, comprehensive search for openings. You just need to search for a job and type which city you are looking for, [ web developer San Francisco ], and then it will pull up listings. I like to filter it down to jobs within the past week, anything beyond has a high chance of being overly saturated with applications.
7. Glassdoor
   Glassdoor has other perks on top of just job listings! Sometimes previous job seekers will submit interview questions that they have been asked. Former employees will post their salaries, benefits, and overall experience while working at XYZ company.
8. NoCSOK
   I like this one because it already filters out postings that say that you don't need a Computer Science degree. They have a nice weekly email subscription that doesn't feel too spammy also.
9. [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com/)
   If you know what you are looking for, this is an excellent concept for finding the team that is the perfect fit. Want a team that pair programs? Eats lunch together? Friends outside of work? Find companies that share those values here.
10. These other classic job postings probably won't get you as many hits, but you can do more research by finding the company on LinkedIn and reaching out to the recruiters or potential devs who would be your boss or colleague.
    LinkedIn Jobs
    Indeed
    ZipRecruiter (really fast one-click applications, doesn't feel like a very legit site for applications though)
11. Remote specific jobs:
    - [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io)
    - [Remote Weekly](https://remoteweekly.cc/)

## Interesting Application Tools üõ†Ô∏è

- Email hunters like [Hunter.io](https://Hunter.io/) and [Clearbit Connect](https://connect.clearbit.com/)
- I have a custom excel sheet that I'm using provided by my Bootcamp to track my applications, but if I didn't, I would use a tool like this [Huntr.co](https://huntr.co//). Once you get into the hundreds of applications, having a reference becomes critical. You want to know when you should follow up, what date you applied, and when you had your first initial phone screen. It seems trivial and tedious, but having this information is pretty essential.
- This is a pretty specific issue but for anyone struggling with adding a preview image to their LinkedIn projects, [here's an article](https://medium.com/@Scotty_Lingner/linkedin-link-preview-images-not-showing-up-try-this-3cd80043b5bb) I wrote on the topic. Not having those preview images was so frustrating and having them there really makes your profile more professional.

## Data Structures and Algorithms üß†

- [Colt Steele's Udemy Course on DSA's](www.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fjs-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass%2F) is very well done, he presents the info in a very calm and collected way.
- [InterviewCake](www.interviewcake.com) has a nice format for teaching everything you need to know about interviewing with DSA questions.
- I've also heard a lot about [AlgoExpert](www.algoexpert.io%2Fproduct) but haven't tried it personally.
