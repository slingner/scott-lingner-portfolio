[Hereâ€™s the challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem).

## Parameters

n: Garyâ€™s number of steps taken on his hike.

s: a single string showing each step (U(up) & D(down))

## Constraints

n: min = 2, max= 10^6 (1,000,000)
s: will consist of the letters U or D

## Output Format

Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.

## Sample Input
8, UDDDUDUU

```astro
sealevel ____/\      ____  sealevel
               \    /
                \/\/
```

## Sample Output

1

## Thought Process Breakdown

<Callout>
  I have been trying to train myself to not jump right into the code and to really wrap my mind around what the question is asking first.
</Callout>

1. We need to split the given string s to track each step.
- create a variable for each step:steps and split it into an array of substrings
2. We need a count of how many times Gary enters a valley during his hike.
- create a variable for each valley entered:valleyCount
3. We need to keep track of Garyâ€™s current sea level status
- create a variable for Garyâ€™s current sea level:currentSeaLevel
4. We need to know the sea level status so that we can tell when he has left one valley and entered another.
- create a variable forvalleyStatus
5. We need to look through each step in the substring steps and do some if/else statements depending on the currentSeaLevel and valleyStatus
6. We need to return the valley count after analyzing each step:
- return valleyCount
-
These are the first things I would write in my function in pseudocode:

```astro
function countingValleys(n, s) {
  let steps = s.split("");
  let valleyCount = 0;
  let currentSeaLevel = 0;
  let valleyStatus = false;
  ***analyze each step
  return valleyCount;
}
```

Now thinking about how to analyze each step:
- I am thinking that a forEach() method would be useful here.

```astro
steps.forEach(step => do something...)
```

- If the step is U(up), add one to the currentSeaLevel variable, and the opposite if D(down)
- If the currentSeaLevelis less than 0 and if Garyâ€™s valleyStatus is checked as false, we will add 1 to the currentSeaLevel and set the valleyStatus to true.
- If the currentSeaLevelis greater than or equal to 0 and if Garyâ€™s valleyStatus is checked as true, set the valleyStatus to false and continue

## Here's my solution without comments:

```astro
function countingValleys(n, s) {
let steps = s.split("");
let valleyCount = 0;
let currentSeaLevel = 0;
let valleyStatus = false;
steps.forEach(step => {
  step === 'U' ? currentSeaLevel++ : currentSeaLevel--;
    if(currentSeaLevel < 0 && !valleyStatus) {
      valleyCount++;
      valleyStatus = true
    } else if(currentLevel >= 0 && valleyStatus) {
      valleyStatus= false
    }
  })
  return valleyCount;
}
```

## Big O Notation

Itâ€™s always important to consider the BigO of your solution. Big0 allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.

For this solution, the BigO would be linear, O(n). The runtime grows as the input grows.

## My solution with more comments

<Callout>
  Similar to my thought process breakdown above but with more comments to explain each step.
</Callout>

```astro
function countingValleys(n, s) {
```

>
 This splits the passed in string `s` into an array of substrings (Garyâ€™s individual steps up and down).*
>  Example: `steps=[U,D,D,D,U,D,U,U]` instead of `UDDDUDUU`.

```astro
let steps = s.split("");
```

>  Create a variable for valleys traversed

```astro
let valleyCount = 0;
```

>  Create a variable for Garyâ€™s current sea level

```astro
let currentSeaLevel = 0;
```

>  Gary doesn't start any hikes already in a valley

```astro
let valleyStatus = false;
```

>  forEach() step in the steps array

```astro
steps.forEach(step => {
```

>   if the step is U(up), add one to the currentSeaLevel variable, and the opposite if D(down)
>> [Learn more about conditional ternary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator)

```astro
  step === 'U' ? currentSeaLevel++ : currentSeaLevel--;
```

>   if the currentSeaLevel is less than 0 (Gary is in a valley, since he started at sea level)
>
> && (*both of these statements need to be true for the following to occur)
>
> if Garyâ€™s valleyStatus is checked as false

```astro
    if(currentSeaLevel < 0 && !valleyStatus) {
      valleyCount++;
      valleyStatus = true
    }
```

>  else, if the sea level is 0 or above
>
> &&
>
> if the valleyStatus is true
>
> set the valleyStatus to false and continue


```astro
    else if(currentSeaLevel >= 0 && valleyStatus) {
      valleyStatus = false
    }
  })
}
```

> after each step in steps has been checked, return the # of valleys Gary hiked through

```astro
  return valleyCount;
}
```

Iâ€™m sure there are other potentially much better ways to solve this, but this is a nice simple way that made sense to me. I think simplicity is important in code. Feel free to leave comments!

Make it so! ðŸš€ðŸŒ€
