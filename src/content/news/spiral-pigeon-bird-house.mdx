      <strong>About the Project:</strong> The design mimics the natural cliff-side habitat of pigeons with individual protected nesting boxes. Each box features an open front for easy access, with the spiral arrangement providing both aesthetic appeal and predator protection. Built with wood and metal in my San Diego backyard, the structure incorporates natural elements like twigs and wooden leaves to create authentic nesting spaces.
    </p>
    <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
      The project involved collaboration with artists and scientists to optimize the design for pigeon colonization. Discussions covered box size, placement height, predator protection, and environmental integration. Scientists noted that pigeons are highly intelligent birds that prefer high, protected spaces mimicking their natural cliff habitat. Artists provided feedback on making the openings smaller to protect nesting birds from cats and other predators.
    </p>
    <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
      The modular design allows for varied box sizes and creates a visually striking sculptural element in the urban landscape. Natural materials were added to encourage colonization, and the structure was positioned to provide both safety and access to food sources.
