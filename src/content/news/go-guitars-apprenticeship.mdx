  <div class="prose prose-stone dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
    <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
      Go Guitars, led by master luthier Sam Radding, has a storied history in the world of guitar making. Sam's influence extends far beyond his own workshop—he taught Bob Taylor, who went on to found Taylor Guitars, one of the most respected acoustic guitar manufacturers in the world today. This lineage of craftsmanship and knowledge represents generations of guitar-making excellence.

      Under Sam's guidance, I've learned the fundamentals of lutherie: selecting and preparing wood, understanding the acoustic properties of different tonewoods, precise joinery, finishing techniques, and the subtle art of voicing an instrument. Each guitar is a unique creation, shaped not just by technical skill but by the builder's intuition and understanding of how wood and sound interact.

    <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
      Working in Sam's shop means learning guitar building the traditional way—with hand tools, patience, and attention to detail. From bending sides with heat and water to carving braces that shape a guitar's voice, every step requires precision and care. It's a practice that demands both technical skill and artistic sensibility.
