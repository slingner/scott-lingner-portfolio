  The Learning Process
</h3>

  <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
    Working in Sam's garage meant learning guitar building the traditional way,
    with hand tools, patience, and attention to detail. From bending sides with
    heat and water to carving braces that shape a guitar's voice, every step
    required precision and care. It's a practice that demands both technical
    skill and artistic sensibility.
