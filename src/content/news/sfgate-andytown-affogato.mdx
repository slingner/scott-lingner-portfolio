  My photograph of Andytown Coffee Roasters' affogato featuring an It's It
  sandwich was highlighted in an article on <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/andytown-coffee-its-it-affogato-17633145.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SFGate</a> about the coffee shop's
    new Richmond District location. The image captures the essence of Andytown's
    innovative approach to coffee and dessert, showcasing their unique take on
    the classic affogato by incorporating the beloved San Francisco treat, the
    It's It ice cream sandwich.

    The article delves into Andytown's expansion and their commitment to
    bringing high-quality coffee experiences to new neighborhoods. My photo
    complements the story by visually representing the brand's creativity and
    dedication to crafting memorable flavors. It's an honor to have my work
    featured in such a prominent publication, celebrating both the art of
    photography and the vibrant coffee culture in San Francisco.
