      The Art exhibit committee at NOTHING HAPPENS GALLERY has reviewed your submission. We appreciate the opportunity to view your selection of artistic work. However, we are unable to offer you a show at this time. Your art work has been buried in a hole. Thank you for your time and interest. We encourage you to submit work to this and other galleries in the future. May the NOTHING HAPPENS GALLERY art hole accept this rejection, and with it, may it become less of a hole.
