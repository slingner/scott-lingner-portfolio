      When the creator of <Link href="https://bedtimehistorystories.com/" external>Bedtime History</Link> reached out to collaborate on a theme song for his educational podcast, I had no idea it would be the beginning of a lasting friendship. The goal was to create something that felt warm, inviting, and captured the wonder of learning about history before bed.

      Working closely with the podcast's creator, we experimented with different melodies and instrumentation to find the perfect sound. The theme needed to be memorable but not overwhelming, setting the tone for stories about historical figures, events, and discoveries that help kids (and adults) learn while winding down for the night.

  <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
      Through this creative process, we discovered we had a shared passion for education, storytelling, and making learning accessible and enjoyable. What started as a professional collaboration naturally evolved into a genuine friendship built on mutual respect and creative synergy.

      The theme song has now opened hundreds of <Link href="https://bedtimehistorystories.com/" external>Bedtime History</Link> episodes, becoming a familiar sound to families around the world. It's incredibly rewarding to know that this small musical contribution has been part of so many bedtime learning moments, sparking curiosity about history in young minds.
