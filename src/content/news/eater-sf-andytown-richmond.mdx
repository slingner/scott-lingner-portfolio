  My photograph of Andytown Coffee Roasters' new Richmond District location
   was highlighted in an article on <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/12/1/23488351/andytown-coffee-open-richmond-ocean-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eater</a> about the coffee shop's
    expansion.

    The article delves into Andytown's expansion and their commitment to
    bringing high-quality coffee experiences to new neighborhoods. My photo
    complements the story by visually representing the brand's creativity and
    dedication to crafting memorable flavors. It's an honor to have my work
    featured in such a prominent publication, celebrating both the art of
    photography and the vibrant coffee culture in San Francisco.
