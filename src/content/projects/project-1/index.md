I worked on Unexpected Frequency, a music website dedicated to exploring all genres, eras, and regions of the world. As a passionate music lover, I am part of a group that loves discussing, listening to, and sharing our passion for music. Whether you're a musician, a music enthusiast, or someone who simply enjoys listening, Unexpected Frequency is the place for you.
