Prenda empowers learners with a child-centered microschool system, an effective learning model, and a supportive community.

My contributions to Prenda include:

## üîí Checkr background check integrations

![Checkr background check](/checkr-background-checks.png)

I streamlined Prenda's onboarding process by integrating Checkr background checks using Checkr's API and webhooks. This allows Prenda to ensure the safety of its learners and guides. Due to the sensitive nature of background checks, I had to ensure that the process was secure and compliant with all relevant laws. The result was a 98% reduction in manual background check tracking by employees and a 75% improvement in the client onboarding process.


## üìã Memory Challenge

I took full ownership of the design and development of this innovative learning tool.

In collaboration with the product manager, curriculum manager, and another software engineer, we designed and developed Memory Challenge from the ground up. Memory Challenge leverages the concept of spaced repetition to enhance student memorization and is currently used by thousands of Prenda students.

The curriculum features engaging games and quizzes in both math and geography. Math quizzes cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while geography quizzes test knowledge of U.S. state capitals, U.S. states, countries around the world, continents, and oceans.

The tool captures detailed data on student learning progress, providing insights into:
- Time taken to answer questions
- Time spent using the tool
- Student engagement (based on the number of badges earned)


## üèóÔ∏è Create projects

![Create projects](/create.png)

In collaboration with the product managers, UX designers, and curriculum designers, I completely revamped the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù learning experience for students and admins with:

- Clear dashboards for students and admins, showing active and completed projects.
- Simple cards to guide students' interest in new projects.
- Easy-to-read lists for non-engineer admins to read, edit, or update all Create projects (currently 101!).
- Improved navigation of all Create projects through a digestible tagging system.
- A ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù section for students to explore and create a list of favorite projects.
- Utilization of Cloudinary and AWS for photo storage and editing.

## üé® Student portfolios

Through close collaboratation with the product managers, UX designers, I created a student portfolio system that allows students to showcase their work and progress. The portfolio system includes:

- A student dashboard that displays all completed projects.
- A project detail page that showcases the student's work, including photos, videos, and written reflections.
- A ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù section for students to explore and create a list of favorite projects.
