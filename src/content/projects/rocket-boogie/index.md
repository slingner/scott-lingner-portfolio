## Rocket Boogie Co

Rocket Boogie is a design studio I co-founded that specializes in whimsical art and lifestyle goods — greeting cards, art prints, home goods, and apparel. To give the store a distinct identity that matched our handmade, illustrative aesthetic, I customized a Shopify theme from the ground up using Liquid, Shopify's templating language.

## Shopify Theme Customization

Rather than using an out-of-the-box Shopify template, I customized a base theme extensively using Liquid to match the Rocket Boogie brand. This involved overriding and extending Shopify's default sections and blocks, building custom layout components, and writing Liquid logic to handle product filtering, variant selection, and dynamic content rendering.

The goal was a store that felt handcrafted — warm colors, custom typography pairings, and a layout that let the artwork breathe rather than feel like a generic e-commerce grid.

## Key Work

- Customized product page templates with Liquid to highlight product details and artwork context
- Built custom collection page layouts with flexible filtering and sorting
- Styled the cart and checkout flow to maintain brand consistency
- Integrated custom metafields to display artist notes and product stories
- Optimized image delivery for product and art print photography

## Tech Stack

- **Shopify** — e-commerce platform
- **Liquid** — Shopify's templating language for theme customization
- **JavaScript** — cart interactions and dynamic UI
- **CSS / SCSS** — custom styling layered on top of the base theme
- **Figma** — design mockups and layout planning
