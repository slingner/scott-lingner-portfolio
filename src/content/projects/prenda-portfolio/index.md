## üéì Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## üé® Student portfolios

Through close collaboration with product managers and UX designers while at Prenda, I developed a student portfolio dashboard that allows students to showcase their work and progress.

### üöÄ Key features

This dashboard seamlessly integrates with Prenda's various learning tools and includes several key features, such as a project detail page where students can display their work through photos, videos, and written reflections. It also includes a "Favorites" section where students can explore and create a list of their favorite projects, along with filtering options by mode, subject, date, and more.

The tool is accessible not only to students but also to teachers, who can approve or reject portfolio submissions and leave comments, fostering a more interactive and supportive learning environment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack

This tool was built using React, with React Router for efficient page navigation, a customized Prenda design system for styling, and AWS for photo storage. Thousands of existing portfolio projects were stored in MongoDB before beginning this project, and we decided to retain the data there while migrating to an updated model to ensure a smooth transition.
