## üéì Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## üß† Memory Challenge

In collaboration with the product manager, curriculum manager, and another software engineer, I took full ownership of the design and development of this innovative learning tool. Memory Challenge leverages the concept of spaced repetition to enhance student memorization and is currently used by thousands of Prenda students.

### üöÄ Key features

The curriculum features engaging games and quizzes in both math and geography. Math quizzes cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while geography quizzes test knowledge of U.S. state capitals, U.S. states, countries around the world, continents, and oceans.

Interactive math quizzes for students to practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

![Memory Challenge Geography](/memory-challenge-geography.png)
Custom-built SVG maps and interactive quizzes for students to learn geography.

The tool captures detailed data on student learning progress, providing insights into:

- Time taken to answer questions
- Time spent using the tool
- Student engagement (based on the number of badges earned)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack

I used React for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend.
