## 🎓 Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## 🏗️ Create projects

In collaboration with the product managers, UX designers, and curriculum designers, I completely revamped the “Create” learning experience for students and admins with:

- Clear dashboards for students and admins, showing active and completed projects.
- Simple cards to guide students' interest in new projects.
- Easy-to-read lists for non-engineer admins to read, edit, or update all Create projects (currently 101!).
- Improved navigation of all Create projects through a digestible tagging system.
- A “Favorites” section for students to explore and create a list of favorite projects.
- Utilization of Cloudinary and AWS for photo storage and editing.
