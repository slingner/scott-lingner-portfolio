## 🎓 Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## 🏗️ Create projects

In collaboration with the product managers, UX designers, and curriculum designers, I completely revamped the “Create” learning experience for students and admins.

### 🚀 Key features

I introduced clear dashboards for students and admins, showing active and completed projects. This helped users easily track their progress and manage their tasks effectively.

To guide students' interest in new projects, I implemented simple cards. These cards provided a straightforward way for students to discover and engage with new opportunities.

For non-engineer admins, I created easy-to-read lists to read, edit, or update all 100+ Create projects. This ensured that even those without a technical background could manage projects efficiently.

I improved the navigation of all Create projects through a digestible tagging system. This made it easier for users to find and organize projects based on their interests and needs.

Additionally, I added a “Favorites” section for students to explore and create a list of favorite projects. This feature allowed students to quickly access the projects they were most interested in.

### 🛠️ Tech stack

I utilized Cloudinary and AWS for photo storage and editing. This integration provided robust and scalable solutions for managing and editing project images.

I also used React for the frontend, and Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend.
