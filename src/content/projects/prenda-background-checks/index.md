## üéì Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## üîí Checkr background check integrations

Previously, Prenda's onboarding process for Guides involved a manual background check process. This process was time-consuming and required multiple steps, leading to delays in onboarding new Guides.

To address this challenge, I integrated Checkr's API and webhooks to streamline Prenda's onboarding process. This integration allowed Prenda to automate the background check process for Guides, ensuring a faster and more efficient onboarding experience.

### üöÄ Key features

I developed a custom solution that connected Prenda's backend with Checkr's API. This integration enabled Prenda to automatically initiate background checks for new Guides, track the progress of the checks, and receive real-time updates on the results.

By leveraging webhooks, Prenda was able to receive instant notifications when background checks were completed. This allowed Prenda to quickly review the results and proceed with the onboarding process without delays.

I also created a dashboard for users to add other adults to their account after onboarding. This feature was vital for the safety and security of Prenda's students, as it ensured that all adults interacting with students had undergone the necessary background checks.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack

On the frontend, I leveraged React along with a custom Material UI design system for seamless styling, while on the backend, I implemented Node.js and PostgreSQL for robust performance. The integration with Checkr's API was achieved using RESTful API calls and webhooks.
