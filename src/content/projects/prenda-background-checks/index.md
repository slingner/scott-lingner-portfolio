## ðŸŽ“ Prenda

During my 4+ years at the EdTech startup Prenda, I had the opportunity to contribute to nearly every aspect of the company, from onboarding Guides to developing custom learning tools for students.

Here is a highlight of one of the projects I worked on:

## ðŸ”’ Checkr background check integrations

I streamlined Prenda's onboarding process by integrating Checkr background checks using Checkr's API and webhooks. This allows Prenda to ensure the safety of its learners and guides. Due to the sensitive nature of background checks, I had to ensure that the process was secure and compliant with all relevant laws. The result was a 98% reduction in manual background check tracking by employees and a 75% improvement in the client onboarding process.
